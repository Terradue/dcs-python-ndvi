Landsat 5&7 NDVI 
================

The Landsat NDVI Python field guide uses the Developer Cloud Sandbox service to implement a Python package using GDAL to calculate the NDVI in Landsat TM 5 and 7 data.

This tutorial builds upon the `Python Scripting for Remote Sensing <http://learningzone.rspsoc.org.uk/index.php/Learning-Materials/Python-Scripting/9.1-Introduction>`_ course by `Landmap <http://learningzone.rspsoc.org.uk/>`_.
