Addressing a scientific / processing goal
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This tutorial targets a simple scientific goal: calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) on Landsat 5&7 data. 

The application will process the Landsat 5&7 products in parallel using a Python module implemented alongside with the application. 

The output of the application, NDVI products, are published on the Laboratory S3 storage.
