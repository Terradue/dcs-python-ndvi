What you will learn
===================

With this field guide application, you will learn:

1. To manage test data in a sandbox - you will copy four Landsat sample products, convert them into the ERDAS image format with gdal and copy the converted products to the laboratory S3 storage
2. To create a simple application - you will implement a Python module and test it against the Landsat data in the ERDAS format uploaded to S3
3. To test the application - you will execute the processing step, inspect the results and finally execute the workflow
4. To exploit the application - you will use the Web Processing Service (WPS) interface to trigger the application
